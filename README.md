Barroz movie Summary

Barroz (also marketed as Barroz: Guardian of Treasures) is an upcoming Indian Malayalam-language fantasy film directed by Mohanlal, in his directorial debut, and produced by Antony Perumbavoor's Aashirvad Cinemas. The film stars Mohanlal in the titular role, alongside Maya Rao West, Cesar Lorente Raton, Ignacio Mateos, Kallirroi Tziafeta, Nerea Camacho and Tuhin Menon.

Barroz

Barroz was announced in April 2019, which was originally written by Jijo Punnoose based on his novel Barroz: Guardian of D'Gama's Treasure. Pre-production works continued for over a year. Principal photography for the film began in March 2021, but was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting changes to the story, screenplay, and cast. Mohanlal and T. K. Rajeev Kumar collaborated to rewrite the scenes, characters, and locations, leading to Punnoose's exit from the film and forfeiting his credits.

Filming restarted in December 2021 and wrapped up in July 2022, where the film was predominantly shot in Kochi and Goa, with two songs filmed in Bangkok and Chennai. The film was completely shot in 3D. The original score was composed by Mark Kilian, while Lydian Nadhaswaram, Fernando Guerreiro, and Miguel Guerreiro composed the songs. Santosh Sivan was the cinematographer and B. Ajithkumar was the editor.
Barroz is scheduled to be released in theatres on 25 December 2024, coinciding with Christmas, in 3D and IMAX 3D formats.
